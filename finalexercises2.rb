#array.delete_if { |item| block }
#Deletes every element of self for which block evaluates to true.

#start_with?([prefixes]+) â†’ true or false
#Returns true if str starts with one of the prefixes given.

#{}"hello".start_with?("hell")               #=> true

# returns true if one of the prefixes matches.
#{}"hello".start_with?("heaven", "hell")     #=> true
#{}"hello".start_with?("heaven", "paradise") #=> false

#Use Ruby's Array method delete_if and String method start_with? to delete all of the 
#words that begin with an "s" in the following array.

#arr1 = arr
#Then recreate the arr and get rid of all of the words that start with "s" or starts with "w".


#Replace the word "important" with "urgent" in this string:


#advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."
#advice.sub! 'important', 'urgent'

flintstones = flintstones.map {|words| words.slice(0..2)}
p flintstones

advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."
...remove everything starting from "house".

Review the Array#slice! documentation, and use that method to make the return value 
"Few things in life are as important as ". But leave the advice variable as "house training your pet dinosaur.".

As a bonus, what happens if you use the Array#slice method instead?

advice.slice!(0,38)
